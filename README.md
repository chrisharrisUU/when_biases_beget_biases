### Structure of the repository

The data files are organized as follows: The main scripts can be found in the folder `Analyses`. These scripts load the raw data (from the `Data` folder), as well as helper functions that have been outsourced to the `Auxiliary` folder. The respective analyses are grouped and in the same order also found in the manuscript, though within groups the order of individual statistical tests might vary slightly. Output (especially the graphs) is saved to the `Output` folder. Finally, the `Survey` folder includes stimulus material as well as the xml-files that make up the experiment as it was run on SosciSurvey.
